### Project: GRUB

GRUB is a quick and efficient solution to search for local dining options, tailored to personal preferences. The user interacts with it using a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the price field for restaurants
  * What it does: Allows the user to set and remove the restaurant price.
  * Justification: This feature adds value because it allows users to know the price range (in the form of an affordability label) of the restaurant before visiting it.
  * Highlights: The feature was implemented in a way that is consistent with the existing codebase, and the GUI was updated to reflect the new feature.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to filter restaurants based on their price label.
  * What it does: Allows the user to filter and find restaurants based on their price label.
  * Justification: This feature adds value because it allows users to quickly find restaurants that match their budget.
  * Highlights: The feature was implemented in a way that is consistent with the existing codebase, and the GUI was updated to reflect the new feature.

* **New Feature**: Overhauled the GUI to improve user experience and aesthetics.
  * What it does: Updated the GUI color scheme and layout to make it more visually appealing.
  * Justification: This feature adds value because it enhances the user experience and makes the application more attractive.
  * Highlights: The new GUI design looks clean, modern, and it was implemented without breaking existing functionality.

  * Managed releases `v1.1` - `v1.6` (6 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())
  * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests [\#36](), [\#38]())
