### Project: GRUB

GRUB is a quick and efficient solution to search for local dining options, tailored to personal preferences. The user interacts with it using a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to rate restaurants.
  * What it does: Allows the user to set and remove their ratings.
  * Justification: This feature promotes a community-driven feedback loop that enhances trust and credibility in restaurant reviews. It benefits tourists and foodies by helping them make better-informed dining choices based on aggregated ratings, while also encouraging restaurant quality improvement through user feedback.
  * Highlights: 

* **New Feature**: Added Storage Safety
  * What it does: Resets the `addressbook.json` to the seeded data when it is empty, corrupted or does not exists.
  * Justification: This features simulates real-world scenario and is added as a backup for users and testers in case they performed `clear`. 

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.1` - `v1.6` (6 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Overhaul the model
  * Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())
  * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage (Pull requests [\#36](), [\#38]())

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the features `delete` and `find` [\#72]()
    * Did cosmetic tweaks to existing documentation of features `clear`, `exit`: [\#74]()
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation details of the `delete` feature.

* **Community**:
  * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#12](), [\#32](), [\#19](), [\#42]()
  * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](), [2](), [3](), [4]())
  * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
  * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([1](), [2]())
